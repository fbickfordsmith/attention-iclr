"""
Define a set of 20 similarity-based task sets. These are subsets of ImageNet
categories that we choose to have varying perceptual similarity (mean pairwise
cosine similarity of VGG16 representations) but equal size and approx equal
difficulty.

Method:
1. Sample 5 seeds.
2. For each seed,
    a. For k in {50, 366, 682, 999},
        i.  Uniformly sample 49 indices from the seed's k nearest neighbours.
        ii. Compute the cosine distance (= 1 - cosine similarity) and accuracy
            of the sampled task set.
3. Check that the sampled task sets give good coverage of similarity values
    between 0.1 and 0.6.
4. Keep the sampled task sets if their accuracy score (normalised distance from
    mean VGG16 accuracy) is better than any previous score.
